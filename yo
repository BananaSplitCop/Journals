1.i see the files nps-2008-jean.dd and nps-2008-jean.info
2.xmount was used in this case becuase of how you are mounting the file nps-2008-jean.E from its orginal file to /mnt/ewf
3.the command that you would use would be xmount file name >xmount  file name
4.nps-2008-jean.dd and nps-2008-jean.info
5.nps-2008-jean.info is not a disk image it shows the info of the nps-2008-jean.dd file
6.this command lists the raw files in the nps-2008-jean.dd file
7.the reason why we changed it is to see everything in the file instead of the more pretty picture
8.a body file is an intermediate file in a timeline of file activity and fls is a tool to output data info.
9.mactime shows when the file was created and when it was opened
mac-robber collects data about allocated files in a mounted filesystem
10.the parts of the mactime command are the date/time,size,activity,permissions,user ID,group ID,inode,and the File name
11.the m means modified or Written,the a means if it was accessed, the c means if the file was changed or not, the b means it a filesystem was created or not

13.jean does alot of clipart amd excel documents on her computer
14.this command shows excel files in the nps-2008-jean.dd
15.this command made the example.xls file in the mnt/ewf directory
16.the 32712 is the entry or the number when the file was created or opened and we can use it to see when the file was used and by who
18.prefetch files are good things for investigators becuase it shows if anything was used to like maybe delete a file,LNK files can have mactime in them showing when the file was opened and can show everything about a file
19.You see LNK files all the time and prefetch only when a file has been deleted
20.They tell us if they are up to anything shady
